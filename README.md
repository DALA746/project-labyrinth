# Project Labyrinth

A pair-programming project where we build a maze game that allows a user to navigate a game, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend. We used the API specified to build a frontend that gives the user control over what to do next. We focused on using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.
